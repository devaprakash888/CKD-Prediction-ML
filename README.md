# CKD-Prediction-ML
This project aims to predict chronic kidney disease (CKD) using various machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and comparison to identify the best performing model for CKD prediction.
# Project Structure
CKD_ML.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing all the code, analysis, and visualizations related to the CKD prediction project.

# Prerequisites
