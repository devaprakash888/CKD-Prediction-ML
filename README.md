# CKD Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques

This project aims to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using various machine learning models. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Project Structure

- `CKD_Prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing all the code, analysis, and visualizations related to the CKD prediction project.
- `kidney_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluating the models.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook

Required libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- xgboost

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
 pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow xgboost
```
